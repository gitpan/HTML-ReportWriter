Revision history for Perl extension HTML::ReportWriter::PagingAndSorting.

1.1  Thu Dec 23 00:12:00 2004
	*** This release is not backwards compatible with previous versions ***
	- Packaged the paging module under the ReportWriter module, now that RW is ready for release.
	- Fixed one bad reference to SORT_DEFAULT, should have been DEFAULT_SORT (in constructor).
	- Removed duplicate line from constructor; setup for PAGES_IN_LIST occurred twice.
	- I made sortable_columns uppercase to match the rest of the arguments.
	- Removed get_paging_stylesheet, and imbedded the default stylesheet into the default template.
	- Fixed reference to HILIGHT_COLOR, should have been HIGHLIGHT_COLOR in constructor & docs.
	- I removed HIGHLIGHT_COLOR and FONT_COLOR since the stylesheet is now handled by RW, thus
	  invalidating the previous change. It's left here for historical bug-tracking reasons.
	- Replaced (DESC|ASC)_IMAGE with (DESC|ASC)_HTML (which could be an image). This enabled me to 
	  set a reasonable default, the HTML entities &uarr; and &darr;
	- Changed the behaviour of the num_results function. Now may return FALSE in certain circumstances.
	  Check docs for details.

1.0.1  Thu Dec 16 12:41:00 2004
	- Fixed name of sub to match documentation
	- Changed sub name to be consistent with other subroutines
	- Updated SYNOPSIS to include a more full-fledged example
