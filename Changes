	- Revision history for HTML::ReportWriter had a version jump from 1.0 to 1.1.
	  This should have been from 1.0 to 1.0.1. This has been fixed.

Revision history for Perl extension HTML::ReportWriter.

1.0.2 Mon Jan 24 07:19:11 2005
	- Fixed bug in column counting. Only caused problems if simplified columns were in use, AFAICT
	- Fixed a ref() check that wasn't accounting for ''. This broke simplified columns completely
	- Fixed broken example code (EXAMPLES section of docs)
	- Removed reference to CGI::Auth::Simple until such time as I can release it
	- Added mysql statements to create demo data for testing the ReportWriter module(s)

1.0.1 Tue Jan 11 17:12:00 2005
	- incremented version number, doc updates. Only real code change was made to PagingAndSorting

1.0 Wed Dec 29 22:30:15 2004
	- Fixed handling of MySQL v4 results -- if you page past the end of the result set, it moves
	  you to the last page of the result set
	- Added support for MySQL 3 using count(*)
	- Broke the CSS into a CSS argument so that it can be overridden
	- Documented the ReportWriter module. Documentation may contain errors.
	  since I don't know how soon I'll be able to proof-read the docs, I'm
      going to upload as-is.

0.9.1 Wed Dec 29 16:47:00 2004
	- Added handling for blank result sets to the default template
	- default blank arrayref for results in draw() to avoid warnings
	- warn on template processing error in draw()
	- updated TODO section

0.9  Thu Dec 23 00:12:00 2004
	- original version

Revision history for Perl extension HTML::ReportWriter::PagingAndSorting.

1.1.2 Tue Jan 11 16:13:00 2005
	- Added 'order' attribute to columns definition to deal with ordering problems on
	  a formatted column

1.1.1 Wed Dec 29 16:47:00 2004
	- removed die() from get_paging_table is NUM_RESULTS is 0. Instead return blank string
	- add !defined checks to avoid warnings if DEFAULT_SORT isn't set and no sort has yet been selected

1.1  Thu Dec 23 00:12:00 2004
	*** This release is not backwards compatible with previous versions ***
	- Packaged the paging module under the ReportWriter module, now that RW is ready for release.
	- Fixed one bad reference to SORT_DEFAULT, should have been DEFAULT_SORT (in constructor).
	- Removed duplicate line from constructor; setup for PAGES_IN_LIST occurred twice.
	- I made sortable_columns uppercase to match the rest of the arguments.
	- Removed get_paging_stylesheet, and imbedded the default stylesheet into the default template.
	- Fixed reference to HILIGHT_COLOR, should have been HIGHLIGHT_COLOR in constructor & docs.
	- I removed HIGHLIGHT_COLOR and FONT_COLOR since the stylesheet is now handled by RW, thus
	  invalidating the previous change. It's left here for historical bug-tracking reasons.
	- Replaced (DESC|ASC)_IMAGE with (DESC|ASC)_HTML (which could be an image). This enabled me to 
	  set a reasonable default, the HTML entities &uarr; and &darr;
	- Changed the behaviour of the num_results function. Now may return FALSE in certain circumstances.
	  Check docs for details.

1.0.1  Thu Dec 16 12:41:00 2004
	- Fixed name of sub to match documentation
	- Changed sub name to be consistent with other subroutines
	- Updated SYNOPSIS to include a more full-fledged example

1.0  Tue Dec 14 17:28:34 2004
	- original version
