HTML/ReportWriter
===============================================

This module provides a simple OO interface to generating pageable,
sortable tabular HTML reports from a database.

Currently, the module supports MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite.
If you'd like to see it work with another DBMS, please submit
a patch containing the necessary get_limit and get_sort functions.

It comes with a default template that allows for quick HTML
generation without any script or file-level dependencies.
