HTML/ReportWriter
===============================================

This module provides a simple OO interface to generating pageable,
sortable tabular HTML reports from a database.

Currently, the module only fully supports (or is represented to work with)
MySQL. This does not necessarily mean that it will not work with other 
DBMSs, however in order for it to do so, you'd likely need to set
MYSQL_MAJOR_VERSION to 3, and the DBMS would need to have LIMIT and ORDER
BY semantics identical to that of MySQL. Optionally, you can override the
data retrieval method (see the docs).

It comes with a default template that allows for quick HTML
generation without any script or file-level dependencies.
